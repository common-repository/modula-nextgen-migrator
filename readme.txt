Migrate away from NextGEN Gallery is the official migrator from NextGEN Gallery to Modula Gallery

== Description ==

Migrate your galleries from NextGEN Gallery to Modula, a user-friendly and customizable WordPress gallery plugin that’s responsive and doesn't require a single line of code to work. We offer an importing tool that makes it easy to move your galleries to Modula without making an effort to rebuild your galleries.

== Why migrate from NextGEN Gallery to Modula? == 

When it comes to user interface, NextGEN might be a little complicated. It will take users some time to understand how to upload images and create a gallery. You may also find it a bit difficult to add the gallery to your post/page. Indeed, this plugin comes with a big bunch of features, but it’s important to remember that too many features can slow down your site.

Don’t worry! Modula offers an easy-to-use interface, and the gallery creation process won’t take you more than one minute. You can easily upload your files or select them from your media library to create a gallery. Below the images, you will find all gallery settings organized in tabs - general (4 grid types, thumbnail, animations), lightbox and links (to open images in a Lightbox powered by FancyBox and create custom links), filters, captions, social icons, loading effects, hover effects and so on.

With Modula, you get a modern solution for your galleries that will impress your potential clients. You also get album creation, watermarking, right-click protection, zoom and EXIF integration, enable downloading, user roles, pagination, and more!

You get the picture: Modula makes everything easier for you! Let’s see some examples of galleries and portfolios that our community has built:


* Real Estate

Awesome, right?! And these are only a few examples. You really can design whatever gallery with Modula. Moreover, we can offer you CSS codes and customization that we’ve been collecting for years. You can find everything you need in our documentation or contact our support team, which is always happy to help.
